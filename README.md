# FacultyManagementApp

## Project Description
This project revolves around crafting and building a web application tailored for university management. Leveraging React for the frontend and a RESTful API powered by Spring Boot for the backend, the primary goal is to empower users in streamlining the management of various university facets. This encompasses overseeing teachers, students, courses, schedules, and classrooms. The application is designed with a user-friendly interface, empowering administrators to effortlessly handle and update university-related information.

There are two branches in this repository, each serving a distinct purpose:

### Backend API Branch
This branch contains the backend API for the project. It is an integral part of the web application designed for university management, built using React and Spring Boot. Its primary function is to streamline various administrative tasks, including the management of teachers, students, courses, schedules, and classrooms. It offers an intuitive interface that assists administrators in staying organized.
### Frontend App Branch
This branch houses the Frontend Web App for the project. Like the backend, it is a crucial component of the university management web application, developed using React and Spring Boot. Its purpose is to simplify administrative duties such as handling teachers, students, courses, schedules, and classrooms through an intuitive user interface. The ultimate goal is to support administrators in maintaining a well-organized system.
